# fake-tweet
fake tweet with pillow

In this project, I aimed to create an image that looks like a screenshot of a real tweet using the pillow library.
The project is completely ready. You can directly run.

An example
>fake = fakeTweet(text='Hello Twitter', imPath='resource/joeBiden.jpg', name='President Biden', username='POTUS', isVerified=True)
>fake.CreateTweet()
